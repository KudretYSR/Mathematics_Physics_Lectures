## How to Use This Page

This webpage is generated from the following GitHub repository: [Physics and Mathematics Hub](https://github.com/dchorazkiewicz/Mathematics_Physics_Lectures).

All sections, except for **Exercises for Students**, contain one or more lecture notes related to the subject. These lecture notes will be used during classes and are intended to help students learn and understand the covered topics.

Students are required to complete a project that involves creating individual repositories containing solutions to the problems listed in the **Exercises for Students** section. These repositories will be based on the template provided at: [Template Repository](https://github.com/dchorazkiewicz/solutions_repo). Detailed instructions can also be found at the same link.
