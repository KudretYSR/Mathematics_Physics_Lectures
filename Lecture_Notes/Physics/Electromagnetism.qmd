## Electrostatics



### Coulomb's Law

In 1785, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb formulated the law that describes the force between two electrically charged particles. This foundational principle quantifies the interaction between charged objects and laid the groundwork for the study of electrostatics.

**Coulomb's Law**:  

Suppose we have a two point charges $q$ and $Q$ at positions $\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)$ and $\mathbf{r}'=(x',y',z')$ respectively. The force $\mathbf{F}$ acting on $Q$ by $q$ is given by

$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{qQ}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|^3}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')
$$

where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.
